# ibm-datascience-course4-practicelab-gdpmillions-by-country
A simple data analysis project to briefly practice what the course touched on.

Some of the key ideas that were touched on in this project were:
- Web scraping - extracting needed table information via the URL given
- Kept only the necessary data needed
- Cleaned and formatted the data to be more easily understood. This was done by converting values and renaming columns

**Project Scenario**:
An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies of the world in descending order of their GDPs in Billion USD (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
