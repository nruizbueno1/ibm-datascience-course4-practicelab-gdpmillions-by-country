# ibm-datascience-course4-practicelab-gdpmillions-by-country
A simple data analysis project to briefly practice what the course touched on.

Some of the key ideas that were touched on in this project were:
- Web scraping - extracting needed table information via the URL given
- Kept only the necessary data needed
- Cleaned and formatted the data to be more easily understood. This was done by converting values and renaming columns
